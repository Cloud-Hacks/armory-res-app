The Restaurant Service App revolutionizes dining. Customers can effortlessly reserve tables, browse menus, place orders, make payments on call, creating a streamlined and user-friendly experience.

How we built it:

We developed the app using a modern frontend technologies, ReactJS. The frontend was designed for intuitive navigation and an appealing interface efficiently managed reservations, orders, and a search option, ensuring a seamless process.

Let's run our app using `yarn start` before that make sure you have installed the dependencies using `yarn install`. The host machine would land you on the home page of Taj Mahal Restaurant App as simple as that.

The menu page shows you the available items as shown below that you can choose and book your order through contact details.
